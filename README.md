# 1st-project
cmst 183 - project from cmst 135
hi my name is ryan and I live in Aledo, Tx. 
the goal here was to make a mock informational site for the railroad I currently work for. The website would convey information for potential riders. I would like to accomplish the following changes to my webpage:
On the schedule page, when the page adjusts to a lower resolution and scales down the table and all the information is lost. I would like the information in the tabel to reformat in a list. 
On the media page, the pictures float over the video. I would like to adjust this so it is more aesthetically appealing. 
I would like to adjust the layout of the header, and columns, and the content in the columns so that everything is more aesthetically appealing.
